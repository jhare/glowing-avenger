Make your data glow. Following the brotocol at all times.

## Why Write ANOTHER Web Grid?

Because I already wrote like twenty linked lists today.

There's things we need to see in a more viable, non-commercial web grid.
Additionally I've seen a couple good grids get developed privately in places but
they remain private.

## Getting Started Using Glowing Avenger

## Column and Data Model

Ideally the data/grid/view you see is a graphical representation of a cross join
between a set of keys (columns) against an array of data (array of plain
objects).

## Plugins

Glowing Avenger is based on a plguin architecture for its core functionality
with some level of duck-typing tying it all together. To remain agile and as
relevant as possible to as many users as possible, there is a plugin system.

## Principles

  Be as forward-thinking as possible. As such....

  * Stick to the plugin architecture. Everything is temporary.
