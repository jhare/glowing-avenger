# glowing-avenger

Make your data glow. Following the brotocol at all times.

## Why Write __another__ Web Grid?

Because I already wrote like twenty linked lists today.

## Getting Started

## Column and Data Model

## Plugins

Glowing Avenger is based on a plguin architecture for its core functionality
with some level of duck-typing tying it all together. To remain agile and as
relevant as possible to as many users as possible, there is a plugin system.

## Principles

  Be as forward-thinking as possible. As such....

  * Stick to the plugin architecture. Everything is temporary.
